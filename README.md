# Kubernetes Ingress and Website Deployment

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the deployment of multiple websites on Kubernetes using Ingress controllers. It includes configurations for both path-based and host-based routing, and secures the websites using TLS certificates.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (Minikube or K3S or another Kubernetes provider)
- kubectl command-line tool
- Docker (for building images, if needed)
- Helm (optional, for managing Kubernetes applications)
- A domain for host-based routing (e.g., `website1.local`)
- Jenkins CI/CD

## Getting Started

### 1. **Setup Kubernetes Ingress Controller**
Deploy your websites by creating the necessary Kubernetes Deployment and Service manifests.

'''bash

kubectl apply -f website1-deployment.yaml

kubectl apply -f website1-service.yaml

# apply ingress.yml place in host-based/path-based-routing folder each

kubectl apply -f ingress.yml

kubectl apply -f ingress_path_tls.yml

### Ingress:
Ensure you have an Ingress controller installed in your Kubernetes cluster. For this repository, we use the Nginx Ingress controller.
Configure Path-Based and Host-Based Routing

    Path-Based Routing: Set up an Ingress resource to route traffic based on URL paths.
    
    Host-Based Routing: Configure an Ingress resource to route traffic based on hostnames.

### Create a TLS Secret with your SSL certificate and private key.
```bash
    kubectl create secret tls website1-tls   --cert=tls.crt   --key=tls.key
```
    
### Jenkins:
    You can also use Jenkins to automate the deployment process into kubernetes environment by used 'Jenkinsfile'

### Access websites Through Browser
- Configure your windows hosts file to enable the access to the both websites (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts) by using      administrative privileges.
```bash
 "your-server-ip website1.local website2.local"
```  
### Notes:

- Customize the paths and hostnames according to your setup.
- Ensure your Ingress YAML files and certificate files are correctly named and located.
- Add any additional setup or deployment instructions specific to your project.
